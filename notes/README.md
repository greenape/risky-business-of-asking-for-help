# Notes

## Initial thoughts

Things to think about:

1. Changing the structure of the game
	-	Self stigma
		-	Changes the information sets (each signaller in own set)
		-	Changes learning, signallers learning only about referral
		-	More complex for the receivers - more effective types
	-	Number of rounds
		- Not clear that there's regularity, or a fixed number of appointments
	-	Players
		-	Obvious choice is social workers
		-	Family might make more sense though - payoffs more difficult
2. What do the payoffs correspond to in real life
	-	Utility and disutility
	-	Utility of living well
	-	Utility of company
	-	Disutility of admitting need
		-	Being a burden
3. What do the beliefs correspond to?
	-	Belief that help will actually be delivered
	-	Belief that help is actually needed/not needed
		-	Is self-stigma overriding need
