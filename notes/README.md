# Notes

## Initial thoughts

Things to think about:

1. Changing the structure of the game - self stigma.
	-	Changes the information sets (each signaller in own set)
	-	Changes learning, signallers learning only about referral
	-	More complex for the receivers - more effective types
2. What do the payoffs correspond to in real life
	-	Utility and disutility
	-	Utility of living well
	-	Utility of company
	-	Disutility of admitting need
