# Parameters, and sources

Belief in referral after asking for help -> can get some gist of this from the OPN surveys with a later life module (e.g. Jan 2011).

Idea is to use proportions of people (over 50) who believe that they will get all the help they need.

From Jan 2011 this looks like:

MCE_1Yes        0.565592 0.0240
MCE_1No         0.163532 0.0180 <- what's the right way to look at this? Take the average of a whole bunch?
MCE_1Don t know 0.257993 0.0204
MCE_1Refusal    0.012883 0.0127

            mean     SE
MCE_11 0.5555313 0.0050
MCE_12 0.1672570 0.0038 <- averaging over the year's OPN surveys
MCE_13 0.2733484 0.0045
MCE_18 0.0038633 0.0009

How do you generate a population to match that? If we say 10 draws, you want 55% of the population with Yes > No, 27% with Yes = No, and 17% with No > Yes

Could just draw for category -> yes with p 55, then draw Yes from a uniform dist 5-10, no is 10-yes?

(Note that this doesn't give you any idea about people who believe they'll get help without asking. This might indicate that we'll need to revise the model.)

Can also look at this based on people's personal experiences - might be useful to look at this against belief change in the agents after playing:

    MCEb_2  MCE_1Yes   MCE_1No MCE_1Don t know MCE_1Refusal se.MCE_1Yes
Yes    Yes 0.6817201 0.1825307       0.1140092   0.02174003  0.03198866
No      No 0.3966657 0.1358957       0.4674386   0.00000000  0.03460050
    se.MCE_1No se.MCE_1Don t know se.MCE_1Refusal
Yes 0.02479683         0.01975136      0.02131815
No  0.02563496         0.03547331      0.00000000

Can do something similar for the belief that they'll get a negative reaction, based on experience of direct prejudice -
